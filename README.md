# Tutorials

## I. [Intro to Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/GHASS19/Intro_to_Gradient_Boosting)

### Main objective:

 - Understand the conceptual difference between bagging and boosting ensembles.

- Understand how gradient boosting works for regression tasks.

- Learn how to tune the key hyperparameters of gradient boosting ensembles.

## II. [Data Cleaning Exercise](https://github.com/GHASS19/Data_Cleaning_Exercise)

 ### Main objective:
 
- Was to clean the  climbing data to prepare it for modeling and machine learning.

- What to do with NaN values.

## III. [Automated Feature Engineering](https://github.com/GHASS19/Feature_Engineering)

### Main Objective:

- Using automated feature engineering as to build hundreds or thousands of relevant features from a relational dataset.

- Calculating a feature matrix with several hundred relevant features for predicting customer churn.

- Ensuring that our features are made with valid data for each cutoff time.

## IV. [Real Estate Investment Plan](https://github.com/GHASS19/Real_Estate_Investment_Plan)

### Main Objective:

- Using a real estate database, find a state for an ivestment property with optimum traits.

- Create graphs in matplotlib to analyze where to purchase the investment property.

- Based upon the data the best place to purchase was the state was Massachusettes. That had a four bed and two bathroom home for less than the mean price.

# Case Studies

## 1. [Bayesian Optimization LightGBM](https://github.com/GHASS19/Bayesian_Optimization_LightGBM_Case_Study)

### Main Objectives:

- Learn how Bayesian Optimization works with a graph of the Gaussian process.

- Test the Bayesian optimization on real flight departures data using the Light GBM.

- Predict if a flight departure is going to be delayed by 15 minutes based on the variables and then find the best results.

## 2. [Linear Regression Red Wine Study](https://github.com/GHASS19/Linear-Regression-Case-Study-of-the-Red-Wine-Dataset)

### Main Objectives:

-  I used linear regression to predict the fixed acidity of wine using just one and then mulitple variables.

- Load and Source the red wine data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis. Displaying heatmaps, pairplot and a few scatterplots.

- Linear Regression Modeling. Our best model was 4. It had an R2 score of .742 and used fewer predictors. 

## 3. [Cowboy Cigarettes Time Series ARIMA](https://github.com/GHASS19/Cowboy_Cigarettes_Time_Series_Case_Study)

### Main Objectives:

- Use the 1949-1960 data to predict the manufacturer's cigarette sales after they stopped in 1960.

- Sourcing and loading the cigarette data. Cleaning, transforming and visualizing or dataset.

- I made the data stationary to prepare it for the ARIMA model. 

- The best p,d, q parameters for our ARIMA model were 2, 1, 1.

- The ARIMA model predicted cigarette sales starting in December of 1960. 

- I concluded that people purchased more cigarettes during the summer possibly due to the good weather, disposable income and time off.
